# Frontend Design Rules

<!-- Auto-loaded by Claude Code when working in frontend directories. -->

## Component Patterns

<!-- Define your component conventions. Example:

- Use functional components with hooks
- Co-locate tests next to components
- Keep components under 200 lines — extract sub-components
-->

## Styling

<!-- Define your styling approach. Example:

- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow the project's design tokens
- Mobile-first responsive design
-->

## State Management

<!-- Define your state management approach. Example:

- Local state for UI-only concerns
- Store for shared/persisted state
- Derive values from state, don't duplicate
-->
