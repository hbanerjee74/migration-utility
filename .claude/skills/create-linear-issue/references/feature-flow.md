# Feature Flow

## Step 1: Proceed or Explore?

Ask the user: proceed with the stated approach, or explore alternatives first?

In both cases, the codebase is reviewed internally for feasibility. The difference is scope.

## Step 2a: Direct Path

Review the codebase directly to assess feasibility and scope.

**INTERNAL (coordinator only):** feasibility, scope signal (XS/S/M/L), constraints.

**FOR THE ISSUE:** numbered requirements + checkbox ACs. Product-level only.

## Step 2b: Exploration Path

When complexity is high, run parallel research (directly or with sub-agents):

1. **Codebase analyst** — feasibility, constraints, scope (internal only)
2. **External researcher** — how similar products handle this, UX patterns, backend patterns

Synthesize into 2-3 product-level options. Always include the user's original approach. No implementation details.

## Step 3: User Picks

Present options clearly and let the user pick one.

## Step 4: Requirements Definition

Write requirements for the chosen approach. Use INTERNAL / FOR THE ISSUE split.

## Step 5: User Refinement

Present requirements. Max 2 clarification rounds, then proceed with best assumptions.
